CFA - Cycle-Frequency Analysis

This project proposes a modification of conventional Time-Frequency Analysis (TFA) to improve the study of cycle-locked event-related potentials. While TFA is a common technique for characterizing spectral changes in neural activity, it has limitations when the event-related activity is cyclic rather than time-locked. This modification aims to address these limitations and enhance our understanding of cyclic neural processes, such as the cortical activity elicited by breathing.
